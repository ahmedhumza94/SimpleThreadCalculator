# Simple Thread Tech Assessment

This document describes my engineering design process while attempting Simple Thread's tech assessment. Parts of this document may not be comprehensive due to time-constraints. In brief, I approach engineering problems starting from user or customer needs and work backwards towards a technological solution.
